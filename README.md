# Programming Language Suggester

#### Quiz to recommend a programming language to new coders, 06.05.2020

### By Jeffrey kim

## Description

Computer programming has always been a fast-growing field and it's easy to feel like you have no idea where to start. Even after starting, many aspiring programmers have trouble understanding programming concepts or how to apply them to their goals. The good news is, a lot of those problems can be mitigated by choosing a good language to start with based on your short and long-term goals.

This website is designed to suggest which language a new programmer should learn. Users are asked a series of questions about why they want to learn to code, which will affect the language that is recommended as a result. Users can also take the quiz multiple times to create a roadmap for their studies and anticipate their learning path as their skills, knowledge, or even their goals change.
